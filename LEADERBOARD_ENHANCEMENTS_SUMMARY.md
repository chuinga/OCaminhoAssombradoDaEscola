### 🎨 UI/UX Features

#### Responsive Design
- All new pages are fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Touch-friendly controls and buttons
- Consistent Halloween theme throughout

- Clear visual feedback for all interactions

### 📊 Data Flow

```
User Action → Frontend Component → API Client → Next.js API Route → AWS Lambda → DynamoDB
                                                      ↓
User Interface ← Formatted Response ← API Client ← Next.js API Route ← AWS Response
```

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Error Handling
- Network error graceful degradation
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback states for offline scenarios

#### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient API calls with proper caching headers
- Lazy loading of components
- Optimized bundle splitting
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management

#### Security Considerations
- Input validation on both client and server
- XSS prevention with proper sanitization
- Rate limiting support in API routes
- Secure sharing URL generation

### 🎯 Requirements Mapping

- **Requirement 9.1**: ✅ Enhanced leaderboard display with filtering
- **Requirement 9.3**: ✅ Social sharing functionality implemented

### 🚀 Ready for Production

All features are implemented and ready for deployment:
- API routes are properly structured
- Error handling is comprehensive
- UI is responsive and accessible
- Code follows project conventions
- TypeScript types are properly defined

The leaderboard enhancements provide a rich, interactive experience for players to:
- View filtered leaderboards by difficulty and time period
- Track their personal statistics and achievements
- Share their high scores on social media
- Compare performance with other players

This implementation significantly enhances the game's social and competitive aspects while maintaining the existing Halloween theme and user experience.
