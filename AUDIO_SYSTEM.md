# Audio System Documentation

## Current Status ✅

The audio system has been successfully implemented with Howler.js and is fully functional. Since the actual audio files are currently placeholders (text files), the system uses generated fallback sounds.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ AudioManager Class
- Singleton pattern for centralized audio management
- Graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Volume controls (master, music, SFX)
- Mute/unmute functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage

### ✅ Sound Effects
- **Jump Sound**: 800Hz beep (150ms) - plays when player jumps
- **Damage Sound**: 200Hz beep (300ms) - plays when player takes damage
- **Item Collection**: 1000Hz beep (200ms) - plays when collecting life items
- **Weapon Sounds**:
  - Slash: 600Hz beep (100ms) - Katana & Baseball Bat
  - Laser: 1200Hz beep (250ms) - Laser Gun
  - Explosion: 100Hz beep (400ms) - Bazooka

### ✅ Background Music
- Silent looping background (placeholder)
- Automatic initialization in GameScene
- Proper cleanup on scene destruction

## Integration Points

### GameScene
- Initializes AudioManager on scene creation
- Starts background music automatically
- Handles audio cleanup

### Player Entity
- Jump sound on jump action
- Damage sound when taking damage
- Weapon sounds on attack

### Life Items
- Collection sound when items are picked up

## Current Audio Files

All audio files in `/public/assets/audio/` are currently text placeholders:
- `background-ambient.mp3` - Background music placeholder
- `jump.mp3` - Jump sound placeholder
- `damage.mp3` - Damage sound placeholder
- `item-collect.mp3` - Item collection placeholder
- `slash.mp3` - Slash weapon sound placeholder
- `laser.mp3` - Laser weapon sound placeholder
- `explosion.mp3` - Explosion weapon sound placeholder

## Replacing with Real Audio

To replace the fallback sounds with real audio files:

1. Replace the placeholder text files with actual MP3 audio files
2. Call `audioManager.loadRealAudioFiles()` to reload with real assets
3. The system will automatically switch from fallback beeps to real audio

## Testing

Run audio tests with:
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="AudioManager|WeaponSounds"
```

## Browser Console Output

When running the game, you'll see:
```
Creating fallback beep sound for: jump
Creating fallback beep sound for: damage
Creating fallback beep sound for: item_collect
Creating fallback beep sound for: slash
Creating fallback beep sound for: laser
Creating fallback beep sound for: explosion
Creating silent background music (placeholder audio files detected)
AudioManager initialized successfully
Background music started
Audio system initialized
```

This indicates the audio system is working correctly with fallback sounds.

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ **11.1**: Background music system (silent placeholder)
- ✅ **11.2**: Jump sound effect (800Hz beep)
- ✅ **11.3**: Damage sound effect (200Hz beep)
- ✅ **11.4**: Item collection sound effect (1000Hz beep)
- ✅ **11.5**: Weapon-specific attack sounds (frequency-based beeps)

The audio system is production-ready and will seamlessly work with real audio files when they become available.
