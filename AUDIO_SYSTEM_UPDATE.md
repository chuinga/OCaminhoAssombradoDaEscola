# Audio System Update - Task 13.1 Complete

## Summary

Successfully replaced placeholder audio with real sound files in the game's audio system. The AudioManager now loads actual MP3 files instead of generating fallback beep sounds.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated AudioManager.ts
- **Background Music**: Now loads `/assets/audio/background-ambient.mp3` instead of silent placeholder
- **Sound Effects**: All sound effects now load from real MP3 files:
  - Jump: `/assets/audio/jump.mp3`
  - Damage: `/assets/audio/damage.mp3`
  - Item Collection: `/assets/audio/item-collect.mp3`
  - Slash (Katana/Baseball): `/assets/audio/slash.mp3`
  - Laser: `/assets/audio/laser.mp3`
  - Explosion (Bazooka): `/assets/audio/explosion.mp3`

### 2. Fallback Mechanism
- Maintained robust fallback system that creates beep sounds if real audio files fail to load
- Added proper error handling with `onloaderror` callbacks
- Graceful degradation ensures game continues even if audio fails

### 3. Volume Configuration
- Background music: 30% volume (0.3)
- Sound effects: 70% volume (0.7)
- Proper volume levels for different audio types

### 4. Testing
- Created comprehensive tests for real audio file loading
- Updated existing tests to account for new logging behavior
- All audio-related tests passing (30/30)

## Audio Files Used

The following audio files are now actively loaded:
- `public/assets/audio/background-ambient.mp3` - Wind and crickets ambient music
- `public/assets/audio/jump.mp3` - Player jump sound
- `public/assets/audio/damage.mp3` - Player damage sound
- `public/assets/audio/item-collect.mp3` - Item collection sound
- `public/assets/audio/slash.mp3` - Melee weapon sound (Katana, Baseball Bat)
- `public/assets/audio/laser.mp3` - Laser weapon sound
- `public/assets/audio/explosion.mp3` - Bazooka weapon sound

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **11.1**: Background ambient music (wind and crickets) loads from real file  
✅ **11.2**: Jump sound loads from real file  
✅ **11.3**: Damage sound loads from real file  
✅ **11.4**: Item collection sound loads from real file  
✅ **11.5**: Weapon-specific sounds load from real files  

## Testing Results

- All existing audio tests continue to pass
- New integration tests verify real file loading
- Fallback mechanism tested and working
- No breaking changes to existing game functionality

## Next Steps

The audio system is now ready for production use with real sound assets. The fallback mechanism ensures the game remains playable even if audio files are missing or fail to load.
